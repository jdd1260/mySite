<p> 
	One day in September I found myself with an unexpectedly free night. With nothing to do, I decided to build something to put on my site and do it using a new tool. What I built was HoodMapper, a page that allows you to build a custom map with markers that you can then share with others. My plan now is to document why I chose this project, what technologies I used and why, what I learned, and what I would change about HoodMapper given more time to work on it.
</p>
<p>
	<ol>
		<li> 
			<div class="header"> Why HoodMapper? </div>
			<div class="body">
				<p> 
					I knew that with less than six hours available to me I wouldn't be able to build anything grand. However, you can skip a lot of steps in a project if you can utilize a great open-source library that can handle a lot of the work for you. I try to keep track of cool/useful libraries as I come across them, even if they aren't immediately useful for my purposes. One that I had taken note of in the past was <a target="_blank" href="http://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a>, a JavaScript library for interactive maps. It seemed pretty easy to use and came with lots of cool features. The feature that I decided to take advantage of for HoodMapper is Leaflet's customizable popup. You can see an example of this right on their home page where there is a marker with a popup saying "A pretty CSS3 popup. Easily customizable." This ability to drop markers and customize popups is what I decided to utilize.
				</p>
				<p>
					At the root of the question "Why HoodMapper?" is a more blunt question: Why would anyone care about HoodMapper? This is a product question, not an engineering question. Yes, I had a cool library available to me, but that doesn't mean it is worth spending time just to learn how to use the library. I wanted HoodMapper to have use. If not in this version, at least in some potential future iteration. The idea I came up with is simple: allow users to create and share a map that contains meaningful or important information for them. Nowadays you can use Google and Yelp to find all the highest rated places to eat in a neighborhood, but what if you wanted to share a map of the places you've eaten with a friend? I don't know of a product that makes that easy, so HoodMapper is designed to meet that need.
				</p>

		<li> 
			<div class="header"> Technologies </div>
			<div class="body">
				<ul>
					<li>
						<a target="_blank" href="http://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a>
						<div>
							I've described Leaflet above, but it really is a cool library for working with maps. I haven't tried to do anything that complex, but it worked pretty well for my purposes. I did have to do some hacky workarounds that were not obvious from the documentation, but I had a good enough of an experience to recommend Leaflet.
						</div>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a target="_blank" href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>
						<div>
							This is an awesome framework for JavaScript development. It's separation of the Model and View as part of the MVW (Model-View-Whatever) framework is excellent. I hate seeing HTML in my JavaScript, as it makes it hard to develop for style and easy to mess things up. It also makes your JavaScript really hard to read. I've seen 10,000+ line files due to all of the HTML inside of it! Angular's two-way data binding is also pretty excellent, and is leveraged in HoodMapper. But the real reason I chose Angular is that it's what I'm best at. With only one night to work I couldn't afford to move forward with a framework that I was less familiar with. 
						</div>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a target="_blank" href="http://tombatossals.github.io/angular-leaflet-directive/#!/">angular-leaflet-directive</a>
						<div>
							One issue with AngularJS is that it does make it hard to use other libraries. In order to integrate into your AngularJS and be done "the Angular way" everything really needs to be presented as a directive. Luckily, the Angular ecosystem is really large, so you can almost always find a wrapper for your library out there already. I found this wrapper, and it worked great.
						</div>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a target="_blank" href="https://lodash.com/">Lodash</a>
						<div>
							This is probably my favorite of all the JavaScript libraries, frameworks, etc. It handles all the basic coding problems that you really shouldn't have to worry about: browser differences, looping, filtering, etc. I also love that it turns JavaScript into a more functional language by adding map, reduce, curry, etc. I love Functional Programming, so having those abilities in JavaScript is very nice. Lodash does so many other useful things as well that I can't possibly do it justice here. Suffice it to say that it is the utility library that I find myself needing for every project I work on. 
						</div>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
			<div class="header"> What I learned </div>
			<div class="body">
				<p> 
					The first thing that I learned is that this is not that hard of a problem to solve. I like my solution, and it was made in only 6 hours! If someone were to dedicate a serious amount of time to this problem I bet we could have a really excellent interactive map tool.
				</p>
				<p>
					I also learned about the complexities of mapping. There is so much that you can do with a map, and Leaflet tries to support a lot of mapping features. But the reality is that I only needed a small number of features. If I were to try to make HoodMapper a legitimate tool I think I would start with a simpler library and build my own features out so that it could be perfectly tailored to my needs.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Finally, I learned that Hackathons are not for me. After a full day of work, spending six hours coding was not great for me. I was pretty much done four hours in, but by that time my brain was pretty fried and it took a lot longer to solve the final problems than it should have. Hackathons do not bring out my best programming skills, but this was still a fun project.
				</p>
			</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
			<div class="header"> What I would change </div>
			<div class="body">
				<ul>
					<li>
						JavaScript framework
						<div>
							I chose AngularJS because I'm familiar with it and knew it could get the job done. However, for a simple one page app like this I think it's probably overkill. I would probably try a more lightweight framework like <a target="_blank" href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://vuejs.org/">vue.js</a>.
						</div>
					</li>
					<li>
						Search
						<div>
							The worst part about HoodMapper right now is that you start off with a world map and have to zoom in on the area you want to cover. It's a long process of zooming to get to the neighborhood level. Being able to input an address, city, etc. and go directly to that would be great - and necessary if anyone was to actually use HoodMapper. 
						</div>
					</li>
					<li>
						Marker Types
						<div>
							I'd like it if a user could create different types of markers that could be color-coded to their type: red for restaraunts, blue for stores, etc. Then the user should be able to show/hide all markers of a given type. This would be great for a map that can contain different type of information without causing information overload.

	Recently I set out to create a space for people to find out who I am and to see projects that I'm working on. Now that I've finished setting up the site I wanted to document the concerns I had, the decisions I made, and how it all worked out. 
</p>
<p class="font-20"> Concerns and Solutions </p>
<p>
	<ol>
		<li> 
			<div class="header"> Cost </div>
			<div class="body">
				I didn't want to be spending money to do this. I'm not sure many people will ever actually see this site, so I couldn't really justify the cost of hosting a site (even though this cost is not really that large). Luckily, GitHub has a really cool <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Pages</a> feature to allow anyone to host a site for their profile or repository - for free. The only downside is that you have to store your code in a public repository on GitHub for anyone to see. Luckily, that fit perfectly into my plan (see below).
			</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
			<div class=" header"> Easily Resusable and Editable </div>
			<div class="body">
				I wanted to make my site easy for people to reuse and customize. GitHub supports forking of <a href="https://github.com/jdd1260/jdd1260.github.io/tree/develop">my repository</a>, allowing others to easily get started with their own site quickly. In order to better facilitate the goal of making it truly easy for others to customize their own site, I have tried to separate the content from the code of the site. This allows a user to edit, remove, or add content without ever touching HTML. The content is stored in easy to follow JSON (see <a href="https://github.com/jdd1260/jdd1260.github.io/blob/develop/templates/default.json">here</a>) that can be changed and personalized. Let's look at an example from the default.json file:
				<pre>
"navBar": [
	{
		"name": "GitHub",
		"link": "https://github.com/jdd1260"
	}, {
		"name": "LinkedIn",
		"link": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/joel-detweiler-0095912b"
	}, {
		"name": "Résumé",
		"link": "/resume.html"
	}, {
		"name": "Tech Blog",
		"link": "/techblog.html"
	}, {
		"name": "Hood Mapper",
		"link": "/hoodmapper.html"
	}		
]</pre>	
				This JSON is defining the content for the navbar on the top of the site; each item in the list corresponds to a link in the navbar. A user need only provide a name and a URL to see that link appear on the page. Additionally, the page supports as many or as few links as you want to provide. As you can see, these links could be to a page on the same site (like resume.html) or to an external site (like LinkedIn). This structure repeats itself across the site so that a user can create their own resume, welcome note, etc. However, if a user would like to customize the site design or add new types of content they will have to do that themselves, which requires a knowledge of HTML and CSS. But I figure that most people who will be forking projects in GitHub can at least do some coding if they so choose.

			<div class="header"> Static Site for SEO </div>
			<div class="body">
				<p>
				In making this site I'd obviously like people to see some of what I put here. But it's really hard for people to find this site if it doesn't show up in search engine results. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization">Search Engine Optimization</a> (SEO) is the name for work that is done to make sure your site is easily found and prominently displayed in search results. You can spend a lot of time and money to make sure that your site excels at SEO, but my main concern is just that my site can be found at all with a search engine. 
				</p>
				<p>
				Since search engines work by crawling the web and reading the HTML files that they find I need to make sure that all the content I want to be indexed by search engines is readily available in HTML files. Now, most of my work experience is in building dynamic websites (especially Single Page Applications) where a lot of the content is generated using javascript. While this can be a great strategy for making highly interactive and data supported websites, it is not great for SEO. So I wanted to make sure that the output of all my work was straightforward HTML and CSS, with javascript having no impact on the actual content of the page. In this way anything I make could be found with a search engine. 
				</p>
				<p>
				Since it I didn't want to be directly working on pure HTML (see concern 2) and I like having additional development tools available to me, I didn't want to be limited to working on HTML and CSS directly. So I needed a development environment that could spit out pure HTML and CSS for the benefit of SEO while also giving me all the power I needed. That is where <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a> comes in. Grunt is a task runner that you can use to perform different jobs and transform your code from how you want to work on it to how you want it to be in its final state. For me, that meant converting HTML templates and JSON content into finalized HMTL, using <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a>  instead of pure CSS, and using minification to ensure that my site would download as fast as possible. Grunt allowed me to do all of that quickly and easily, reusing the work that others have made available. To see  the details of how it works check out my <a href="https://github.com/jdd1260/jdd1260.github.io/blob/develop/Gruntfile.js">Gruntfile</a>.

			<div class="header"> Mobile Friendly </div>
			<div class="body">
				Everything needs to be mobile friendly nowadays - my site needs to look as good on mobile as desktop. My favorite tool for this is responsive web design with <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>. Bootstrap, along with media queries in CSS (using <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a>), allows your single HTML structure to adapt based on the browser window size. No need for a mobile site or duplicated HTML - just let your page adjust based on the space it has. My best work of this kind was on  <a href="http://motionmathgames.com/">my company's home page</a> (which also uses this same project structure).
			</div>
		</li>
	</ol>
</p>
<div class="margin-top-20">
	I'm still figuring out what I want this website to be, how it should look (I'm aware that it could be prettier), and how to market it. However, with how well my current site structure fits my broader technical requirements, I'm pretty confident that it can easily adapt to my needs.
